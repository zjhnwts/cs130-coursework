									<h2>What are the Interdisciplinary Subjects?</h2>
								</header>
									<p>The purpose of interdisciplinary research is to achieve integrated research on problems 
										by transcending the previous research methods of categorization. The interdisciplinary mode 
										of thinking is to satisfy the curiosity of exploring unknown fields, to ask the right questions 
										in the face of difficult situations and point out multiple directions, and to stand shoulder 
										to shoulder with collaborators in other fields and collided with the sparks of inspiration. 
										The music theory which has been accumulated over thousands of years can also have the support 
										of mathematical group theory; Complicated mathematical models in economics can also be interpreted 
										by psychological cognitive factors and verified by experiments. The same social problem in 
										cultural studies, anthropology, psychology, biology, applied mathematics will lead to different 
										thinking and interpretation. At Acalab, you will meet like-minded partners, follow the torch of 
										scientific truth, and use the cross-disciplinary thinking mode to recognize, question and change 
										the world. To solve the great challenges facing society, scientists and industry must work together. 
										Exploiting energy is not just about extracting resources where they are available. The layout of 
										buildings requires knowledge of physical architecture, the impact on the local natural ecological 
										environment requires knowledge of biology, and the political factors brought by it require knowledge 
										of politicians and sociology. In solving social problems and academic problems, the research beyond 
										the traditional academic boundaries is always the most comprehensive and effective.</p>

									<h2>The Importance of Independent Research</h2>
								</header>
									<p>Independent research ability is an important part of the cultivation of academic ability 
										and academic thinking. Researchers need to have the ability to choose problems, to solve 
										problems independently, to explore unknown areas and design solutions, and to have ideological 
										collisions with collaborators. However, the ability to do independent research is not limited 
										to academic research. Every year, tens of thousands of doctors or research masters choose to 
										work in industry or think tanks; Large enterprises set up research departments including mathematics, 
										economics, cognitive science, data science, engineering and so on (R& D). Even in non-research-based 
										work or daily life, we often have to consider the combination of different environmental, psychological, 
										cultural and other factors. The problems revealed by a social phenomenon will involve the 
										cross-interaction between individuals, groups and social backgrounds. Social phenomena reveal issues 
										involving the interplay of individuals, groups, and social contexts that 
										require consideration by research thinking and rigorous research methods or models.</p>

									<h2>What does an ideal interdisciplinary laboratory look like?</h2>
								</header>
									<p>Founded in 2017, Acalab is a non-profit academic group dedicated to promoting education 
										and research in the social sciences and cutting-edge interdisciplinary disciplines. Bringing 
										together research practitioners from academia and industry, Acalab provides young students from 
										around the world with the opportunity to learn and practice cutting-edge scientific exploration 
										through its annual interdisciplinary science summits and research "incubation" program.

										​</p>
										
										
										<p>
											In the traditional single arrow teaching, the educated are more passive in learning knowledge 
										and lack of active participation. In the future, however, there will be more emphasis on interactivity 
										-- students will feel more involved and learn more efficiently. At present, interactive teaching 
										mode is still limited to text and music; With the progress of science and technology, more diversified 
										cognitive technologies will be applied to academic fields, such as touch, taste, and even smell.
										
										</p>
										
										<p>
										With this in mind, Acalab wants to open up avenues of collaboration between disciplines, providing 
										students with an open, interactive "lab" atmosphere. Mentors from different academic fields and industries 
										bring more cutting-edge interdisciplinary science projects to students, combining theory with practice. 
										Acalab will provide experimental funding and conference space for interactive presentations, creating 
										an ideal social science and interdisciplinary laboratory. The lab is designed with a number of semi-open 
										Spaces and meeting rooms with interactive screens. The contents of tablet computers and mobile phones can 
										be projected on the screen anytime and anywhere, and the sparks of inspiration can be recorded on white 
										boards and glass walls. From the moment students step into Acalab, they learn, research and interact with 
										their peers and mentors in a relaxed and open environment. Acalab encourages students to take a holistic 
										and inclusive view of the problem, to incorporate all aspects of 
										the project into the scope of research and to explore more possible areas for the future.</p>

								<ul class="features1">
									
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-sitemap"></span>
										<h3>Diversity</h3>
										<p>The Acalab Interdisciplinary Summit offers multiple research projects for students to choose from. 
											Each research project crosses the research barriers of a single discipline. The 2019 Summit projects 
											include Linguistics and Philosophy, Experimental Economics and Computer Science, East Asian Studies 
											and Sociology, Gender Studies and Cognitive Science, Bioinformatics, and Music Production and Engineering.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major solid fas fa-globe greencolor"></span>										
										<h3>Cooperation between teachers and students</h3>
										<p>We believe that successful research is based on successful collaboration. 
											In the project, students not only learn about the academic background and mainstream 
											research direction through class discussions, assignments, and question-answering under the
											leadership of the teaching assistant, but also explore the topic with researchers 
											through seminars, in-depth reading of academic articles, and critical writing.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Research Methods</h3>
										<p>During the summit, students will conduct independent research on one aspect of a cross-cutting 
											topic under the guidance of academic leaders and professors. Due to the different emphases of 
											different disciplines, the project research also covers research methods in multiple fields, 
											including but not limited to text close reading, literature review, field experiments, case analysis, 
											laboratory experiments, data statistics and analysis, model building, etc.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major solid fa-ship yellowcolor"></span>
										<h3>Presentation</h3>
										<p>Academic presentation and presentation are indispensable skills in research. The students 
											will present their research in a variety of ways at the Acalab Symposium on the final day of 
											the summit. Excellent research results or experimental reports will be presented on multiple 
											media platforms, and the academic team and professors will recommend relevant experimental 
											research, academic conferences or social practice opportunities, and help students to 
											contribute articles to academic journals and magazines in the field.</p>
